# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## I will be using this repo as a journal log. The code done during this challenge will reside in other repos made for those projects. Links will be provided here.

### Day 1: 3/14/18 Pi Day

**Today's Progress**: Forked #100DaysofCode challenge repo (first fork)
 and started Personality Text Classifier using a Myers Briggs data set provide by Mahek Hooda on Kaggle 
 
**Thoughts:** The data set came with two columns: One for personality type and one with fifty text elements separated by "|||". I wanted to separate them so that I had more entries to work with. The data set has 8675 rows. Had trouble separating at first, then found a function made by a Kaggle user that worked but used BeautifulSoup and re. I then tested so see if the re input with my original separater code was enough...turned out it was :). Yeah for experimenting

### Day 2: 3/15/18 

**Today's Progress**: Began Exploratory Data Analysis on melted dataset
 
**Thoughts:** Made use of the os library to change directory for the first time. Used [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) bar and dendrogram to explore null values and use pandas to remove them (done before this project). Interesting to see that introverts may be proving more online text content then extroverts. Will of course explore further. EDA to be continued.
