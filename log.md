# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## I will be using this repo as a journal log. The code done during this challenge will reside in other repos made for those projects. Links will be provided here.

### Day 0: 3/14/18 Pi Day

**Today's Progress**: Forked #100DaysofCode challenge repo (first fork)
 and started Personality Text Classifier using a Myers Briggs data set provide by Mahek Hooda on Kaggle 
 
**Thoughts:** The data set came with two columns: One for personality type and one with fifty text elements separated by "|||". I wanted to separate them so that I had more entries to work with. The data set has 8675 rows. Had trouble separating at first, then found a function made by a Kaggle user that worked but used BeautifulSoup and re. I then tested so see if the re input with my original separater code was enough...turned out it was :). Yeah for experimenting
